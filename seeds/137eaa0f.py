# In the input you will see some objects scattered around on a black grid. Each object has a single grey pixel, but everything else is a single other color.
# To make the output, place each object into the output grid such that the grey pixel is in the center of the output.
# Equivalently, move the objects to line up all their grey pixels so they overlap.
# The output grid should be the smallest possible size that contains all the objects (after they have been placed correctly), which for all the inputs here is 3x3.
