# description:
# In the input you will see a pyramid with a flat base (possibly rotated), with a single special pixel inside of it that is a different color. The special pixel is centered in the base of the pyramid, opposite the tip of the pyramid.
# To make the output, draw a line starting from the tip of the pyramid and extending outward infinitely (away from the pyramid). The color of the line is the color of the special pixel.
